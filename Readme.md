Abstract![ref1]

Networking, which is one of the most significant aspects of information technology revolution, is developing increasingly day after day. This is because it offers a huge amount of knowledge, resources and human experiences. Our project works on client-server architecture. This not only monitors the network traffic but also provides security and control towards unauthorized access. The connection to the server is totally wireless and can be created through wireless network (e.g. hotspot). It provides confidentiality of data and we can also block the unauthorized user from the network. We can connect multiple devices to the server. The security is provided in the network through encryption and decryption of data. The file can be shared within thARIJEETGHOSALe network in an encrypted manner so that data safety is ensured.

Originality

- This type of applicationisn't available in market yet.
- We have combined network monitoringwith network control
- Data confidentialityof client is ensured using AES Encryption.
- Sharing files between systems in the network
- Centralized Network, one adminhas control over the network
- Attackers can be removed from the network by admin

Innovation

- We have added Network Monitoring with network control to ensure data security which are not provided by network monitoring tools present in the market. ARIJEETGHOSAL
- Attackers or unauthorized users can be removed from the network by admin
- Data confidentialityensured using AES encryption technique
- Simplifieduser-interface
- No need to install separate software on client system![ref3]![ref4]![ref5]

Highlight the originality of the project.

=>

There are network monitoring tools in the market today but none which can control the network traffic along with network monitoring. Our application allows you to control network traffic along with monitoring the traffic. Files can also be shared inside the network. Data confidentiality and Data security is critical for every industry/academic institute which is ensured by our application for which we have used AES encryptiontechnique.

Literature Survey![ref1]

- ***Network Traffic Monitoring Analysis System with Built-in Monitoring Data Gathering***

This research proposes a model based on client-server architecture which monitors the network traffic. In this model, a server is connected to multiple clients and a software is installed on the client side machine which runs in the background and turns on as soon as the client computer is turned on and is turned off only when the client computer is turned off, this software on the client machine is used to track the activitiesof the client.

combining two or more computers that are running applications into a single virtual cluster, NLB provides reliability and performance for web servers and other mission-critical servers. NLB allows all of the computers in the cluster to be addressed by the same set of IP addresses

- ***Introduction to NetworkProgramming***

This research helps us in thorough understanding of various types of networks-LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network), PAN (Personal Area Network), SAN (Storage Area Network), GAN (Global Area Network), MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), CAN (Controller Area Network), DAN (Desk Area Network), VPN (Virtual Private Network). But the most commonly used networks are LAN, WAN, MAN.

- ***Theory and Implementation of Data Encryption Standard***

This research indicates that DES is a block cipher, and encrypts data in blocks of size of 64 bit each, means 64 bits of plain text goes as the input to

DES, which produces 64 biARIJEETGHOSALts of cipher text. The same algorithm and key are used for encryption and decryption, with minor differences. The key length is 56 bits. It mention that DES uses a 56 bit key. Actually, the initial key consists of 64 bits.![ref3]![ref4]![ref5]

- ***Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm to Encrypt and Decrypt Data***

The features of AES are as follows−

1. Symmetric key symmetric block cipher
1. 128-bit data, 128/192/256-bit keys
1. Stronger and faster than Triple-DES
1. Provide full specificationand design details
1. Software implementablein C and Java

Operation of AES

AES is an iterative rather than Feistel cipher. It is based on ‘substitution– permutation network’. It comprises of a series of linked operations, some

of which involve replacingARIJEETGHOSALinputs by specific outputs (substitutions) and others involve shuffling bits around (permutations). Interestingly, AES performs all its computations on bytes rather than bits. Hence, AES treats the 128 bitsof a plaintext blockas 16 bytes.![ref3]![ref4]![ref5]

- ***A Framework for Wireless LAN Monitoring and Its Applications***

This research paper shows that for network diagnosis purpose (e.g., anomaly detection and security monitoring) such wireless information is more useful than information provided by wired network or SNMP. To understand the characteristics the measurements have been conducted on the wired portion of the network or SNMP logs. These measurements can provide precise traffic statistics. It provides an insight on how to apply wireless monitoring technique for traffic characterization and network diagnosis.

- ***A Study on Implementation and Application of Java Database Connectivity Drivers***

This research paper provides in-depth study of drivers of JDBC with their pros and cons along with features of JDBC. Type 1 driver act as a bridge between JDBC and other database connectivity mechanism. It converts JDBC calls into ODBC calls and redirects the request to the ODBC driver. Type 2 driver make use of java native interface (JNI) call on database specific native client API. Type 3 driver translates the JDBC calls into a databse server independent and middleware-specificcalls. Type 4 driver interacts directly with database

Methodology of the Project Work![ref1]

- ***Advance Encryption Standard(AES)***

In our project, we are using AES as our encryption algorithm which provides 16 bits alphanumeric secret key for ensuring data safety from attacker. Even files shared from server to client or vice versa will be shared in an encrypted manner so that even if the dashboard is left open by mistake he can only view the file and not it’s contents, and if an unauthorized person tries to access the data, he will be asked for the secret key in order to download the data.
